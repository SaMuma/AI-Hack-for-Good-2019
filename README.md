Project Purpose:
Ideas for micro:bit programs that can be programmed for use by students

Project Ideas:

1) Moods 
- student would be able to submit their mood through the microbit device. Pressing A button will cycle through the mood icons (happy face, neutral face, sad face). Pressing B button will submit the student's mood. Throughout the day students will be able to submit their moods multiple times. Data will be saved to a cloud-hosted database (Azure SQL). Power BI could be used to generate visualizations for a teacher to monitor class sentiment throughout the day. 
- data collected could also be used to identify potential mental health concerns with a student who is consistently reporting unhappy moods. Guidance counselor can engage with student or parents can be given resources that point to additional support for the student.

2) Activity levels
- students would have a wearable device (either on hand or leg) programmed to use the shake sensor on the microbit to track and display the number of times it shakes which would either be tracking their physical activity (in or not in gym class) during the day by tracking number of steps or such.
- data collected could be used to correlate to moods, or even back to performance in school for each student and to determine whether or not a higher level of activity during the day is accounting for increased success in classes. Data can be collected, stored and visualized to determine such insights using Azure SQL and Power BI.

3) Confidence in math/STEM
